<h1>Using Reactjs to build, netlify to deploy, and Traversy to guide I have built this Github finder. </h1>

<a href = "https://djangosgithubfinder.netlify.app/">Full Site</a>

Users can enter a name into the search bar

The app will make a request to the github API for users with or related to that name.

Then the user can click on a profile to view their latest 5 repositories, username, website, activities,  as well as find a link to the selected users github profile.
